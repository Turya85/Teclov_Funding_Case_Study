The notebook focuses on exploratory data analysis and clustering within a dataset that includes fields such as company identifiers, compensation (CTC), job positions, and years of experience (YOE). It performs data preprocessing, including handling missing values and removing duplicates, followed by feature engineering to calculate metrics like YOE and creating categorical flags for designations, classes, and tiers. The analysis also incorporates statistical summaries, visualizations of trends, and clustering to classify employees by their earnings and experience levels.
